            <p>Minidiscs are a portable audio format that shrinks compact discs into a 3 inch disc, while still retaining the information. 
            You will need a Minidisc player, usually these are made by Sony since Minidisc was a Sony format originally.
            Minidisc players are vastly different from each other in terms of portability and ease of use, 
            but if you want the easiest device to print new discs on, try and find a player with NetMD capability.
            These players use the power of the Internet to send burn data to the laser, eliminating the need for optical cables or line in.</p>
