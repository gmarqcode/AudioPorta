            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a fan of audio, with a focus on music. 
            My favorite methods of listening are cassette, vinyl, and minidisc.
            It may seem cumbersome to bring my music with me physically, but in my opinion it helps me stay offline and away from a hyperfocus on my phone. 
            When I allow myself to experience the tactility of a physical audio player, I allow it to be both the background and focus of my time.
            Sadly, companies do not produce high quality physical audio players like they used to.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Since most companies that were masters at portable audio do not produce their players anymore,
                    it is pretty much insured that any player you buy today is used. This is not a bad thing, but be sure to check the condition of the player before buying it.
                </li>
                <li>I usually scroll through <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> to find cheaper players, and if you are willing to do the work to 
                repair older devices, you can get some good deals.</li>
                <li>I prefer to go on Facebook Marketplace as well, since there are many people local to me who are looking to get rid of old audio players that they may not need.</a></li>
            </ol>
