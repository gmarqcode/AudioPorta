            <h2>Listening Experience</h2>
            <p>Cassettes are a fun format because they blur the line between analog and digital.
            You need a cassette player for portable use, or deck for at home listening.
            I personally prefer to take my cassettes with me, and frame my day with 1-3 albums.
            Since cassettes are an analog format, their audio information is easy to manipulate through physical means.
            Some players come with speed control so you can listen to music in a whole different way.
            Music artists also may perform with something called a tape loop, in which a cassette is quite literally taped to extend its length to provide ambience to build upon.</p>
